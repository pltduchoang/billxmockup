# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
## UI toolkit

### Context
We are in the process of selecting a UI toolkit for our React Native mobile app.
The UI toolkit choice will significantly impact the app's user interface design, components, and overall user experience.

### Decision
We have decided to develop a native app using the React Native framework.

### Rationale
* Cross-Platform Support: Native Base is known for its cross-platform support for both iOS and Android, which aligns with our requirement to reach a wide audience on different devices.
* Rich Component Library: Native Base provides a comprehensive library of pre-designed UI components, including buttons, forms, headers, and more. This extensive component library will significantly accelerate the development process and reduce the need for custom design and development.
* Customization and Theming: Native Base offers a high level of customization and theming capabilities. This flexibility enables us to create a unique and visually appealing user interface that aligns with our app's branding and design requirements.
* Community and Documentation: Native Base has an active developer community and provides extensive documentation, making it easier for our development team to access resources, receive support, and troubleshoot issues as they arise during the development process.
* Integration Ease: Native Base integrates seamlessly with React Native, offering ease of integration into our existing development workflow. This will help streamline development and reduce potential integration challenges.
* Scalability: The scalability of Native Base allows us to accommodate future feature expansions and the app's potential growth while maintaining design consistency.

### Consequences
* Integration Challenges: While Native Base integrates with React Native, there is a potential for integration challenges or conflicts with other third-party libraries and packages. These challenges may lead to delays in development and troubleshooting efforts.
* Performance Impact: Extensive customization and theming can introduce performance overhead, particularly on lower-end devices. This may impact the app's responsiveness and user experience, requiring additional optimization efforts.
* Complexity: Native Base's customization capabilities, while beneficial, can also introduce complexity into the app's codebase. This may lead to challenges in maintaining and extending the app in the long term.

### Considered Alternatives
We considered alternative UI toolkits like React Native Elements and UI Kitten. While these options have their strengths, we chose Native Base due to its extensive component library, customization capabilities, and strong community support.

### Summary
The decision to adopt Native Base as the UI toolkit for our React Native app was based on its cross-platform support, rich component library, customization and theming options, community and documentation support, and ease of integration. This choice will contribute to the efficient and visually appealing development of our mobile app.
