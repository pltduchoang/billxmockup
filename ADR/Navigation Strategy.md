# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
## Navigation Strategy

### Context
We are in the process of designing the navigation strategy for our React Native mobile app. The navigation strategy plays a crucial role in ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive user experience.

### Decision
We have decided to implement a hybrid of Tab Navigation and Bottom Tab Navigation as the primary navigation strategy for our React Native app.

### Rationale
* Tab Navigation: We are incorporating Tab Navigation to provide easy access to different sections or categories within the app. This navigation approach is suitable for our app, which contains distinct and essential sections that users frequently access.
* Bottom Tab Navigation: We are opting for Bottom Tab Navigation to place the primary navigation tabs at the bottom of the screen. Placing tabs at the bottom is a common design pattern on mobile platforms, particularly on Android, and it aligns with user expectations.
* User-Friendly Experience: The hybrid approach combines the strengths of Tab and Bottom Tab Navigation to create a user-friendly and intuitive experience. Users can access primary sections with a single tap, while the bottom tab layout ensures easy access with one-handed usage.
* Cross-Platform Consistency: The hybrid approach is designed to provide a consistent user experience across both iOS and Android platforms. This consistency is crucial to make navigation patterns familiar to users on both platforms.
* Ease of Implementation: React Navigation, which supports both Tab and Bottom Tab Navigation, allows us to implement this hybrid strategy efficiently. The development team is familiar with React Navigation, simplifying integration.
* Customization: The chosen navigation approach offers a high level of customization, enabling us to tailor the user interface and navigation experience to align with our app's branding and design requirements.

### Consequences
* Integration Challenges: Combining Tab and Bottom Tab Navigation may introduce integration challenges. Ensuring smooth transitions between different navigational patterns may require additional development effort and testing.
* Complexity: The hybrid approach can introduce complexity into the codebase, especially when customizing navigation behavior. This complexity can lead to challenges in maintaining and extending the app in the long term.
* Performance Impact: Extensive customization and complex navigation structures can introduce performance overhead, potentially affecting the app's responsiveness and user experience, necessitating additional optimization efforts.

### Considered Alternatives
We considered alternative navigation strategies, including Stack, Drawer, or Top Tab Navigation, but the hybrid approach aligns best with our app's structure, user expectations, and user-friendliness.

### Summary
The decision to implement a hybrid of Tab and Bottom Tab Navigation as the primary navigation strategy for our React Native app was made, acknowledging potential integration challenges, increased complexity, and potential performance impacts as potential negative consequences. These concerns will need to be addressed during the development process to ensure the app's success.
